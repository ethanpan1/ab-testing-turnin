      <h1>A/B Testing</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="title-description">
      <p>For this assignment, I implemented an A/B test for a mock cactus shop
        website. I practiced data collection for A/B tests, as well as skills in
        statistical analysis, specifically two-sample t-tests and chi-square
        tests.
    </div>
    <div class="part">
      <h2>Part 0: Creating Hypotheses for Statistical Tests</h2>
      The first part of the assignment was to modify a template to create two
      versions of a cactus shop website. These two versions would be used for
      our A/B test. I've included screenshots of both pages, as well as the
      link to <a href="immense-scrubland-61011.herokuapp.com">the deployed app</a>.
      <br>
      <div class="screenshots-container">
        <div class="screenshot-container">
          A
          <img alt="a-screenshot" src="a-screenshot.png" class="screenshot">
        </div>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
          B
          <img alt="b-screenshot" src="b-screenshot.png" class="screenshot">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      In particular, I was curious whether really minute changes in the interface
      would have significant effects on the metrics I'd be testing. As such, I
      changed the subheading of the page, the font of the price (italic vs. bold),
      and the color of the item count. While I changed the images to be more
      aesthetically pleasing, they and their layout were the same in both interfaces.
    </div>
    <div class="part">
      <h2>Part 1: Creating Hypotheses for Statistical Tests</h2>
      I ended up testing two metrics for my A/B test. The first was the <b>time to
      complete</b> the task: adding at least $150 of cacti to the cart. The second
      was the <b>return rate</b>: how often users went to the checkout page and back
      to the buying page. I created null and alternative hypotheses for both.
      <br>
      <div class="hypothesis-container">
        <h3>Time to Complete</h3>
        Null hypothesis: <i>Users do not differ in the amount of time spent buying
        cacti between interface A and interface B.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        Alternate hypothesis: <i>Users spend less time buying cacti in interface B
        than in interface A.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
  	    Explanation: Prices are bolded rather than italicized, making them more noticeable or easier to find.
  			Subheading is shortened and less interesting, so users may spend less time reading it.
      </div>
      <div class="hypothesis-container">
        <h3>Return Rate</h3>
        Null hypothesis: <i>Users do not differ in how frequently they return to the
        cactus buying page between interface A and interface B.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        Alternate hypothesis: <i>Users more often return to the cactus buying page in
        interface A than in interface B.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        Explanation: The “X in cart” counter is green in interface A, highlighting it and
        potentially encouraging users to return and look at the item counts. This likely would
        not change how often users underspend in their first attempt at the task, but could change
        whether they choose to go back anyway.
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="part">
      <h2>Part 2: Collecting Data and Applying Scripts</h2>
      As described above, I tasked users to add at least $150 worth of cacti to the cart. I fielded
      users through Piazza as well as by messaging my friends. I then extracted user logs through
      Heroku and filtered them. I proceeded to preprocess the data and run it through scripts that
      applied the statistical tests.
    </div>
    <div class="part">
      <h2>Part 3: Conclusions and Takeaways</h2>
      I created an infographic to display the results of the tests. As it states, interfaces A and B
      were not statistically different in time to completion or return rate.
      <br>
      <div class="infographic-container">
        <img id="infographic"src="AB infographic.png" alt="test-infographic" height="840" width="600">
      </div>
      Some takeaways from the assignment:
      <ul>
        <li>Even if the means may suggest significance, it all comes down to sample size.
          My sample size was very low, so there wasn’t enough statistical power to substantiate
          the difference in means.
        <li>My users were not acting entirely naturally, especially since my classmates participated in
          my A/B test among many others. This limits the results.
        <li>It is still unclear whether such minute changes can have significant effects on user behavior.
          Larger design changes, like layout or navigation, are more likely to have significant effects.
      </ul>
